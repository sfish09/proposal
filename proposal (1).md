# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

What’s your password?

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that generates a password or takes a user inputted password and tells how strong or weak it is. If user inputs password program will offer suggestions on how to change (or suggestions on new passwords).

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable - N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable – N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

My final project will generate password or take user input password, no matter what – may not output suggestions.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Final project will generate strong password, gage user input, and output suggestions to make their password stronger.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Ideal outcome for project is to generate password as well as generate suggestions for strong password, if applicable. And possibly have an element of amusement (maybe…)


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next step is to research and understand coding on a website, starting with the tools provided in Canvas. I will research what makes a strong password; this includes the number of characters, symbols, length, etc. I will need to acquire the skills and better knowledge on how to work on a program outside of IDLE. I will also need to grow my ability to set up the website, outside of just the code (i.e. appearance).
